# Intro & Background

The American Time Use Survey (ATUS) is a time-use survey of Americans, which is sponsored by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. Respondents of the survey are asked to keep a diary for one day carefully recording the amount of time they spend on various activities including working, leisure, childcare, and household activities. The survey has been conducted every year since 2003.

new.packages <- list.of.packages[!(list.of.packages %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
if(length(new.packages)) install.packages(new.packages)
install.packages("tidyr")
