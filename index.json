On the Y axis you have the attributes and on the X axis you have the time.\n Plots 1 I want to create plots showing each artists songs on their album and what they show about the danceability, tempo and speechiness.\nHopefully i can answer the question of whether songs had more danceability in the past or now and whether speechiness or tempo had anything to do with it.\nI created an example plot showing The danceability of all of Drake’s music plotted against the tempo. I wanted to see if tempo had an effect on danceability , which from the plot you can see, it does not.\nThe thing we’re gonna be plotting against the most is the change in an artists’ songs over time. With time being the x-axis, we’re gonna plot the different attributes of an artists’ tracks and/or album and see the change over time. Starting with Drake, a plot was generated below. As you can see, dancebability and speechiness doesnt seem to have enough of a prevalent relatonship to really analyze anything we couldnt have already seen anyway.\n Plots (continued) So now, im gonna try to see if I can take each variable individually (speechiness, tempo and danceability) and plot it against the time of its release for Drake’s whole collection of songs, not just from his album Scorpion.\nStarting off with danceability, a plot was created below.\nNow We’re getting somewhere, as you can see, apparently Drake’s songs have gotten more danceable over time and apparently in 2015 none of his songs seemed to be danceable at all!\nMoving on to speechiness, a plot was generated below\nI used a line plot to see whether Drake’s songs have gone down or up in terms of speechiness and I have to say I agree with the visualization, being a Drake fan myself. I feel like Drake is known for his speechiness and in the plot you can see that he started out very speechy back in 2009, his beginnings.Since then though, its gone down and stayed in limbo really going down and up little bits. After an all time low in 2014 it looks like he went through limbo again until he got it together and is now back on a rise in 2017.\nLastly, I wanna see the role tempo has played in all of this.A plot was generated below.\nReally, his tempo has been all over the place and i can attest to that. His highest year in tempo was in 2012.\n ","date":1539216000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1539216000,"objectID":"2ba30e90127da0f5a3f5e6c03336b20e","permalink":"/project/spotify-analysis/","publishdate":"2018-10-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/spotify-analysis/","section":"project","summary":"Analysis of Spotify Artist Data","tags":["analysis","dataviz","R"],"title":"Spotify Analysis","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":["data analysis","R"],"content":"Intro \u0026amp; Background The data used for this project was downloaded from kaggle, and include information about “pet licenses issued by the Seattle Animal Shelter between 2005 and early 2017.”\n Data The data gets read in using the read.csv function in R.\n## install packages if necessary #install.packages(\u0026quot;janitor\u0026quot;) #install.packages(\u0026quot;ggplot2\u0026quot;) #install.packages(\u0026quot;dplyr\u0026quot;) #install.packages(\u0026quot;lubridate\u0026quot;) #install.packages(\u0026quot;zoo\u0026quot;) #install.packages(\u0026quot;forcats\u0026quot;) #install.packages(\u0026quot;ggthemes\u0026quot;) #install.packages(\u0026quot;knitr\u0026quot;) ## load packages library(janitor) library(ggplot2) library(dplyr) ## ## Attaching package: \u0026#39;dplyr\u0026#39; ## The following objects are masked from \u0026#39;package:stats\u0026#39;: ## ## filter, lag ## The following objects are masked from \u0026#39;package:base\u0026#39;: ## ## intersect, setdiff, setequal, union library(lubridate) ## ## Attaching package: \u0026#39;lubridate\u0026#39; ## The following object is masked from \u0026#39;package:base\u0026#39;: ## ## date library(zoo) ## ## Attaching package: \u0026#39;zoo\u0026#39; ## The following objects are masked from \u0026#39;package:base\u0026#39;: ## ## as.Date, as.Date.numeric library(forcats) library(ggthemes) library(knitr) pets \u0026lt;- read.csv(\u0026quot;/cloud/project/data/seattle_pet_licenses.csv\u0026quot;)  Plots I then generated a plot showing how many species are included in the dataset.\nggplot(pets) + geom_bar(aes(x=species)) + ylab(\u0026quot;Amount\u0026quot;)  ","date":1539043200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1539043200,"objectID":"79293a2bc49d6d1f798f60a3f27abbde","permalink":"/project/are-people-getting-more-cats-or-dogs/","publishdate":"2018-10-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/are-people-getting-more-cats-or-dogs/","section":"project","summary":"Analysis of Pet Licenses Issued in Seattle","tags":["analysis","dataviz","R"],"title":"Are People Getting More Cats or Dogs?","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":["data analysis","R","survey data"],"content":"","date":1539043200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1539043200,"objectID":"417a9ab4a70e991fb50bde97f1f0937f","permalink":"/post/steak-survey-data/","publishdate":"2018-10-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/steak-survey-data/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":["analysis","dataviz","R"],"title":"Steak Survey Data","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["R","survey data","data analysis"],"content":"Intro \u0026amp; Background The data used for this project were downloaded from FiveThirtyEight - steak-survey.

Previous work can be computationally intensive and is mainly based on low-level cues extracted from RGB data and implemented on a PC for a fixed sensor network (such as traditional CCTV). We present a practical and efficient framework for mobile devices (such as smart phones and robots) where high-level semantic soft biometrics are extracted from RGB and depth data. By combining these cues, our approach attempts to provide robustness to noise, illumination, and minor variations in clothing. This mobile approach may be particularly useful for the identification of persons in areas ill-served by fixed sensors or for tasks where the sensor position and direction need to dynamically adapt to a target. Results on the BIWI dataset are preliminary but encouraging. Further evaluation and demonstration of the system will be available on our website.","tags":[],"title":"A Person Re-Identification System For Mobile Devices","type":"publication"},{"authors":["GA Cushen","MS Nixon"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1372636800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1372636800,"objectID":"caae70970030052c8f733b2ca8421a2b","permalink":"/publication/clothing-search/","publishdate":"2013-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/clothing-search/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a mobile visual clothing search system whereby a smart phone user can either choose a social networking photo or take a new photo of a person wearing clothing of interest and search for similar clothing in a retail database. From the query image, the person is detected, clothing is segmented, and clothing features are extracted and quantized. The information is sent from the phone client to a server, where the feature vector of the query image is used to retrieve similar clothing products from online databases. The phone's GPS location is used to re-rank results by retail store location. State of the art work focuses primarily on the recognition of a diverse range of clothing offline and pays little attention to practical applications. Evaluated on a challenging dataset, the system is relatively fast and achieves promising results.","tags":[],"title":"Mobile visual clothing search","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
